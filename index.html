                forgives, Allah adds to his respect; and the one who shows humility, Allah elevates him in the
                estimation
                (of the people).” (Muslim)</h3>

                    <h3>Shelters</h3>
                    <p>Our Trust started out as a day care centre for street children. Over a period of time, we
                        realised
                        that a safe space is the most critical need for any child to realise his/her own full potential.
                        Thus, we started residential programmes to provide safe, comfortable and friendly shelters for
                        children rescued from the street or any other distress situations.</p>

                    <h3>Education</h3>
                    <p>The intensive engagement with street children to transform them into capable and thinking
                        individuals is carried out by enabling access to education and empowering children with skills.
                        We
                        help channelize the energy and intelligence of young children into different forms of education
                        and
                        give children a safe environment to study and hone their skills.</p>

                    <h3>Nutritious Meals</h3>
                    <p>Nutritionally-balanced, hot-cooked meals are served at all residential centres and contact
                        points.
                        The meals are prepared under the supervision of staff members to ensure safe and hygienic
                        practices.
                        Unwell children with different nutritional requirements are provided special meals including
                        protein
                        supplements, additional fruits and milk as prescribed by the doctor.</p>

                <h1>Flood Relief Program</h1>
                <p>Around 13 lakh people were affected in Sylhet city, including five Upazilas. Surma and the Kushiyara
                    rivers started flowing above the danger level. The heavy torrential rainfall in the north-eastern
                    region and India's Meghalaya and Assam has left parts of the district paralysed since May 12. The
                    cyclonic storm Asani worsened the situation. Some families have taken shelter in higher grounds, but
                    many more live in waist-high water, with no place to go. 13 lakh people are water-bound. As a part
                    of the emergency response, our volunteer team is working on the spot and planning to provide
                    emergency support, food, water purifying tablets, medicine, and more to the people in flood-affected
                    areas. It will be beneficial if you lend a hand.</p>
